## Overview  
This mod enables string replacement in [Deus Ex: Mankind Divided](http://store.steampowered.com/app/337000) and [Deus Ex: Breach](http://store.steampowered.com/app/555450) to facilitate game translation to languages that aren't officially supported (e.g., Turkish). The framework loads in-game strings from a JSON file specified in the configuration, allowing anyone to create or modify their own translation set.  

## Installation  
Copy **version.dll**, **DXMD_Mod.ini**, **strings.json**, and (if necessary) your custom font into the `\retail\` directory (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail`).  

**Note:** The [latest MSVC Redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) must be installed to run this mod. If you get an error about a missing `vcruntime140_1.dll`, you probably don't have it installed.  

## Keybinds  
None yet.
  
You can change keybinds and other settings by navigating to your `\Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail\` folder and editing `DXMD_Mod.ini`.
